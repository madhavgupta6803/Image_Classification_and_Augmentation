# Image_Classification_and_Augmentation
Introduction to Machine Learning Course Project
The CIfar_DS303_Final.ipynb file consists of the CNN model 
and the results of the different classifications we did
on the Cifar10 dataset.

The UcMerced_DS303_CNN.ipynb file consists of the classification
done using image augmentation and training a CNN model 
on 9 classes with the accuracy results with wrongly classified pictures.

The image_classification_using_conv.ppt contains the workings of a CNN model, the datasets we used, 
how we pre-processed the data followed by training and testing the model.
After that, it has the final accuracies of each model with their losses 
and accuracy graphs with the model summary. In the end, we have mentioned 
the work distribution of the team and the references we used.

NOTE:- Demo results are shown in the ipynb files itself and 
	 link to the research paper is provided in the ppt.
